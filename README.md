# CS300

In these projects, I focused on efficiently managing and organizing course information by selecting and implementing the most suitable data structures. Each structure—Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree—had its own strengths in terms of speed, memory usage, and complexity. The challenge was to balance these factors to find the best solution for the task at hand. The process deepened my understanding of how to choose data structures based on practical needs, like data size and operation frequency.

Overcoming the roadblocks, such as dealing with hash collisions in Hash Tables or ensuring a Binary Search Tree remains balanced, taught me to approach software design with a more practical mindset. I've learned to write code that is not only efficient but also maintainable and adaptable. These projects have enhanced my technical skills and refined my ability to make thoughtful, informed decisions in software development.
